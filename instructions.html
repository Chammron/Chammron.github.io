    <h2>Step 0: Prep your Ingredients</h2>

    <p>
        As simple as it sounds, this step is the key to success with smashburgers. Once heat gets involved, things move incredibly quickly so you won't have time to hunt for salt or slice veggies.
        Have plates at the ready along with all of your toppings and condiments prepped and in reach. It's also best to have both your meat and butter close to room temperature.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Toast your Buns</h2>

    <p>
        This step is optional but really brings your burger to restaurant quaility levels. Spread a thin layer of softened butter on each side of your open buns.
        Lay face down on your preheated pan and allow them to reach a golden brown color. Place the two sides back together and set aside.

    <h2>Step 2: Smash and Season your Patty</h2>

        Turn your heat up to medium-high. Loosley form your ground beef into evenly divided meatballs. One by one, place these into your very hot pan and immediately smash with your chosen recommended untensil.
        Be sure to plan your spacy as each burger will need space to spread out to about 1/4" thickness. Season generously with salt and add pepper to taste. Cook for 2 minutes or until you see the crust clearly
        forming around the edges.      
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Flip and Add Cheese</h2>

    <p>
        Using your metal spatula, carefully scrape up all the thinner edges and flip your burger. Add your cheese and fry two minutes more. Remove from pan and transfer to your plated buns.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Put your Burger Together</h2>
