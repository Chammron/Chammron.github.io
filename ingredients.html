    <h2>73/27 Ground Beef</h2>
    <p>
        Although different fat to lean ratios can be used for these burgers, higher fat content can more easily create the signature smash burger crust. 
        80/20 ground chuck would also be acceptable. Fresh is always best, but frozen is totally usable once thawed.      
    </p>
    <h2>American Cheese</h2>
    <p>
        American cheese is a classic choice due to its easy meltability and familiar cheeseburger role. That said, pretty much any cheese can be the right choice depending on the flavor profile you're aiming for.
        Pepper jack, provolone, swiss, all provide variety that can change up the finished product fairly dramatically.
    </p>
    <h2>Brioche Buns</h2>
    <p>
        Brioche buns possess a slightly sweet, buttery flavor that lends itself to smash burgers along with their pillowy texture. Potato buns can offer a lot of similar qualities as well.
        Pretzel buns offer an entirely different flavor and trexture that brings pub burger vibes, but really any bun you prefer can be used.
    </p>
    <h2>Salt and Pepper</h2>
    <p>
        Good quality beef has a flavor all its own but a solid dose of salt and pepper makes all the difference in the end. Salt especially is key to a tasty final product.
        Any further seasoning is not really required, with the crust of the beef and the condiments doing so much heavy lifting, but can be expanded upon based on personal taste. 
    </p>
    <h2>Sweet Pickles</h2>
    <p>
        Pickle flavor is personal preference and can depend on the final flavor profile you're aiming for, but sweet slices often give that desired contrast to a salty, savory burger.
        Sweet-hot are a fantastic choice as well for a little flare and sour or dill slices are always a classic choice. 
    </p>
    <h2>Onions</h2>
    <p>
        Onions and beef are time-honored companions. Thinly sliced raw red, white or yellow onions add crunch and spark. Sliced grilled, carmelized onions add a sweeter, more mellow depth of flavor.
        Personally, I love that raw onion bite, but the choice is yours.
    </p>
    <h2>Lettuce</h2>
    <p>
        Shredded iceburg lettuce is really the only way I roll but if you prefer leaf lettuces, microgreens, or even spinach, those are great ways to justify your creation as "healthy".
        The crunch, freshness and added volume are all solid reasons to remember the lettuce.
    </p>
    <h2>Tomatoes</h2>
    <p>
        Again, this condiment is 100% personal choice but a thinly sliced tomato, joining forces with the lettuce, onions, and pickles really balances the fatty, salty, savory flavors of the burger,
        giving it the balnce that makes it a stand-alone complete meal.
    </p>
    <h2>Ketchup</h2>
    <p>
        A classic burger topping, the familiar sweet tang brightens your smashburger with its subtle tang. If you're looking for more, pick up a spicy version for next-level flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Mustard</h2>
    <p>
        Classic yellow mustard is no stranger to burgers but feel free to visit some less familiar flavor profiles with a spicy stone-ground or dijon if your other condiments allow for a more adventures choice.
    </p>
    <h2>Mayo</h2>
    <p>
        Mayo tends to be a bit of a polarizing condiment but it can add a creamy, fatty element to your burger that can really round out the flavor profile but if you're not a fan, don't worry about it. 
    </p>
    <h2>Butter</h2>
    <p>
        Butter will be what we use to coat the buns before toasting them. This will give them a nice golden brown color and a bit of extra flavor.
