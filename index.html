    <h2>Why Smash Brugers?</h2>

    <p>
        My favorite dinner when I was young was burgers, and my mom, brother, and I did Friday-night burger nights in the summer, which are some great memories of mine. 
        We didn't have a lot of money when I was a kid, and those nights are something I look back on with appreciation because I remember her wanting to make those nights as special for us as possible. 
        Sentimentality aside, smash burgers are a great meal since they take the near-perfect recipe of a burger and add crispy crust to the patty. 
        Their ease of preparation makes them an excellent recipe for beginners and a great dish to impress others with.

        This is a pretty simple recipe, and while it does recommend a few abnormal peices of kitchenware you may not find in your average household, they shouldn't be too costly and the ingredients will be basic. 
        Hopefully, you are already have these items in your kitchen, but if that's not the case, you will find them easily in your grocery store or online and I'll provide some suggestions if not later on. 
        What matters most though is that you're really excited to try making this recipe and are ready to learn how you can make a delicious burger!
