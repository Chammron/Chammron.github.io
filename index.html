    <h2><center>Why Smash Brugers?</center></h2>
    <p>
        My favorite dinner when I was young was burgers, and my mom, brother, and I did Friday-night burger nights in the summer, which are some great memories of mine. 
        We didn't have a lot of money when I was a kid, and those nights are something I look back on with appreciation because I remember her wanting to make those nights as special for us as possible. 
        Sentimentality aside, smash burgers are a great meal since they take the near-perfect recipe of a burger and add crispy crust to the patty. 
        Their ease of preparation makes them an excellent recipe for beginners and a great dish to impress others with.
